Objective: to create a responsive website for myself :
1. to promote myself & my real estate business & possibly get some leads for my business; 
2. to challenge myself to learn how to code & take advantage of being in the center of Seattle Tech Hub; & last but not least
3. to produce an awesome portfolio to open myself up to lucrative job opportunities in the coding world.

Guidelines:
1. To incorporate EAT (expertise authority trustwworthiness) in the website. IE to create a content what potential users wants and loves and create a link from reputable and important pages such as bloomberg and cnbc real estate news.

Various important sources of property news such as CNBC and Bloomberg; and statistics from Northwest MLS will be incorporated into the website as API.
